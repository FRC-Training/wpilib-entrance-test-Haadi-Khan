		 * Sorry about the dumpster fire that is this program. I should have used OOP instead, but since I was sick and have been incredibly
		 * busy, this was best I was able to do. I understand how to do OOP, but after 9 pm, my brain turns to mush when it comes to classes and objects.
		 * Sorry about this once again, but for most of the tasks, it performs adequately.
		 * 
		 * Just realized that inheritance with implements would have made this much better as well. Oh well.
